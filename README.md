I am an aspiring web-developer and a tech enthusiast who has always been interested in breaking into the tech field. Coding and programming have always been one of my greatest passions, which led me towards joining a coding bootcamp Actualize. My experience going through it, was quite immersive as I learned to do what I had always wanted to do.
